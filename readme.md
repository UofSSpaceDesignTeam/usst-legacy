## Legacy Software Goes Here!
This is recent code for old rovers that use a different codebase than the main rover.
It is probably not going to be as well updated or organized as the main software in the master branch.

Tread carefully! ;)

Current supported platforms:
1. Plywoodbot Demo (w/ Drive Board Mk2.0)
2. Marco Mk2.5 Demo

Planned supported legacy platforms
1. Marco Mk1.0 (Pending hardware upgrade)
